# iusearchbtw Release README 🚀

Welcome to **iusearchbtw**, the one and only language where the sacred phrase is:

```
i use arch btw
```

## How to use

Once you have the **binary release** of `iusearchbtw`, you can run it on any Linux system. It takes a `.iusearchbtw` file as input and prints the decoded message.

### Example usage

```bash
./iusearchbtw test.iusearchbtw
```

This will read `test.iusearchbtw` and print the corresponding characters based on the number of `i use arch btw` inside each parenthesis.
